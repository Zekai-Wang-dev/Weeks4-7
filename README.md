You can walk forwad or backward by pressing 'w' or 's' on your keyboard

Once the distance UI shows that you walked 4m, a monster will appear

There should be a UI icon that shows the monster's weakness beside its healthbar

Select the weapon from the dropdown menu to match the monster's weakness and press attack to deal damage to the monster

Once the monster's health has reaches 0, it will die and disappear. 

Continue walking forward until you reach the next monster

Enjoy.
